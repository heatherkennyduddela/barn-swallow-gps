This file contains details about the data processing and analysis for relating GPS movement data of female barn swallows to their extra-pair mating outcomes in terms of the proportion of extra-pair young in their clutch, and the number of sires represented in each clutch. 

The steps described require the following software: 

* R and RStudio

For details about processing genomic data and caclulating pairwise relatedness, see the README file in the [genomic-workflow](#genomic-workflow) folder.
