Variable names and descriptions for the CO-2021.thin10k.GL-relate file
Each row is a pairwise comparison between two of the individuals in the data set.
This table is the output of relatedness calculations done using the software lcMLkin. 

Ind1 - sequence ID of individual 1
Ind2 - sequence ID of individual 2
k0_hat - estimated kinship coefficent 1
k1_hat - estimated kinship coefficent 2
k2_hat - estimated kinship coefficent 3
pi_hat - estimated relatedness value, equivalent to (k1/2) + k2
nbSNP - number of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) used for calculating the k and pi values
